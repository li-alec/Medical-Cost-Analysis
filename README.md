# How Can We Lower Our Medical Bills?
**About:** This project is about the effects of certain factors in an individual's health and its relation with medical costs. We will dive into health factors such as age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, and region and their effects on medical bills. The dataset was sourced on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance. This project entails a 4 step analytical process where I will delve into objectives & scope, data cleaning & preparation methods, EDA, and lastly provide an actionable plan for reducing Medical Costs.

**Future:** This project is still in the works as I continue to be excited to learn more! I will include a Forecasting Model in the near future to allow for accurate prediction of medical costs.
